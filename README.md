# WindowMover
A console application that resizes and moves a specified window. This project
was created in order to allow exact positioning of a window on an ultrawide
monitor. While window-snapping works well, the window will expand to fill the
entire region that it's snapped to. This program works like window-snapping,
but it allows you to specify the exact size and position of the window.
